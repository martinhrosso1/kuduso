# 🎉 Stage 1 Implementation Complete!

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **Stage 1 - Mocked Compute Loop** for the Kuduso project. All three services are built and working together with contract validation, correlation tracking, and comprehensive testing.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **AppServer (Node.js)** - `shared/appserver-node/`
Internal service that validates contracts and routes compute requests.

**Features:**
- ✅ `POST /gh/:def::ver/solve` endpoint
- ✅ Input/output validation using Ajv + JSON Schema Draft 07
- ✅ Deterministic mock solver
- ✅ Correlation ID propagation
- ✅ Structured JSON logging
- ✅ TypeScript with hot reload

**8 files created**

### 2. **API (FastAPI)** - `apps/sitefit/api-fastapi/`
External-facing API for job management.

**Features:**
- ✅ `POST /jobs/run` - Submit jobs
- ✅ `GET /jobs/status/{id}` - Poll status
- ✅ `GET /jobs/result/{id}` - Retrieve results
- ✅ In-memory job storage (Stage 1)
- ✅ Synchronous AppServer calls (Stage 1)
- ✅ CORS enabled for frontend
- ✅ Pydantic request/response models

**5 files created**

### 3. **Frontend (Next.js)** - `apps/sitefit/frontend/`
Web UI for SiteFit app.

**Features:**
- ✅ Simple input form (CRS, seed)
- ✅ Job submission via API
- ✅ Status polling every 1s
- ✅ Result display with transforms and KPIs
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ TypeScript + React
- ✅ Inline styling (no framework yet)

**8 files created**

### 4. **E2E Tests** - `tests-e2e/api/`
Comprehensive test suite using pytest.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Happy path with valid inputs
- ✅ Invalid input validation
- ✅ Direct AppServer calls
- ✅ Correlation ID propagation
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ Deterministic results

**4 files created**

### 5. **Development Tools**
- ✅ Updated Makefile with service commands
- ✅ [.env.example](cci:7://file:///home/martin/Desktop/kuduso/apps/sitefit/frontend/.env.example:0:0-0:0) files for all services
- ✅ README documentation for each component
- ✅ STAGE1_COMPLETE.md with full details

**Total: 26 files created for Stage 1**

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start All Services

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
make install

# Start all services at once (requires tmux)
make dev

# Or start individually in separate terminals:
make dev-appserver  # Port 8080
make dev-api        # Port 8081  
make dev-frontend   # Port 3000
```

### Use the App

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Adjust CRS or seed if desired (default: EPSG:5514, seed 42)
3. Click **"Run Placement"**
4. View results immediately with:
   - Rotation and translation transforms
   - Quality score
   - Metrics (area, distance, etc.)
   - Full JSON output

### Run Tests

```bash
# All tests (contracts + e2e)
make test

# E2E only
make test-e2e
```

## 📊 Architecture Flow

```
User → Frontend (3000) → API (8081) → AppServer (8080) → Mock Solver
                            ↓
                      In-Memory Storage
                            ↓
                    Frontend (polling) → Results
```

**Key Features:**
- Contract validation at AppServer level
- Correlation IDs flow through entire system
- Structured JSON logging everywhere
- Same seed = same results (deterministic)

## 📋 Exit Checklist (All Complete!)

- [x] AppServer validates inputs & outputs; returns deterministic mock
- [x] API exposes `/jobs/run|status|result`; synchronous mock call works
- [x] Frontend form triggers a run and renders results
- [x] E2E test passes using contract examples
- [x] Correlation IDs flow through responses & logs

## 🔄 What's Next: Stage 2

**Stage 2 - Messaging & Persistence** will replace:
- Synchronous API → AppServer calls → **Service Bus messages**
- In-memory job storage → **Supabase database**
- Direct processing → **Worker service** consuming from queue

**The contracts and endpoints stay the same!** Only implementation changes.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Contract-driven development** - All validation uses schemas
2. **End-to-end flow** - User can submit jobs and see results
3. **Observability** - Correlation IDs tracked everywhere
4. **Testing** - 7 E2E tests covering happy/error paths
5. **Developer experience** - Single `make dev` command
6. **Documentation** - Every service has README + examples

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Intentional for Stage 1)

- In-memory storage (jobs lost on restart)
- Synchronous processing (blocks during compute)
- No persistence layer
- Mock results only
- Single process (no scaling)

These will be addressed in **Stage 2** and beyond.
