# Stage 2 Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Foundation

### What We Built

1. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   infra/
   ├── modules/shared-core/        ✅ Complete
   ├── live/dev/shared/core/       ✅ Complete
   ├── terragrunt.hcl              ✅ Complete (root config)
   └── README.md                   ✅ Complete
   
   scripts/
   └── setup-state-backend.sh      ✅ Complete
   ```

2. **shared-core Module** - Platform Resources
   - ✅ Resource Group
   - ✅ Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   - ✅ Log Analytics Workspace
   - ✅ Key Vault (with RBAC)
   - ✅ Storage Account + artifacts container
   - ✅ Service Bus Namespace
   - ✅ Container Apps Environment

3. **Configuration Files**
   - ✅ Root Terragrunt config with state backend
   - ✅ Provider configuration (azurerm ~> 3.80)
   - ✅ Dev environment config
   - ✅ Module variables, outputs

4. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Infrastructure README
   - ✅ Stage 2 deployment guide
   - ✅ State backend setup script

### Ready to Deploy

You can now run:

```bash
# 1. Setup state backend
./scripts/setup-state-backend.sh
export TF_STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=kudusotfstate

# 2. Deploy platform core
cd infra/live/dev/shared/core
terragrunt init
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply

# 3. Setup Key Vault secrets
# (See STAGE2_DEPLOY.md for detailed commands)
```

## 🔄 Next: Phase 2 - Images + Rhino VM + AppServer

### What We Need to Build

1. **Docker Images**
   - Build AppServer, API, Worker
   - Push to ACR
   - Tag with git SHA

2. **rhino-vm Module**
   - Windows VM with public IP
   - NSG (ports 80, 8081 from your IP only)
   - Install Rhino.Compute
   - Store API key in Key Vault

3. **shared-appserver Module**
   - ACA app (internal ingress)
   - Managed identity
   - ACR pull role
   - Key Vault secret refs
   - Environment variables for compute URL/API key

### Questions Before Phase 2

1. **Docker Images**: 
   - Do you want to build/push images now, or create the Dockerfile(s) first?
   - AppServer already has a Dockerfile?

2. **Rhino VM**:
   - What VM size? (e.g., Standard_D2s_v3)
   - Do you have Rhino.Compute installer/license ready?
   - Or should we use a pre-configured image?

3. **AppServer Deployment**:
   - Should it use mock compute initially? (USE_COMPUTE=false)
   - Port 8080 internally?
   - How many replicas? (min=1, max=3?)

---

## 🎯 Phase 3 - App Stack (sitefit)

After Phase 2, we'll create:

1. **app-stack Module**
   - Service Bus queue
   - API (ACA, external)
   - Worker (ACA, internal, min=0)
   - KEDA scaler
   - All with managed identities and secret refs

## 📋 Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| State Backend | ✅ Ready | Script created, needs to be run |
| shared-core module | ✅ Complete | Terragrunt config ready |
| shared-core deployment | 🔄 Pending | Waiting for you to run `terragrunt apply` |
| Key Vault secrets | 🔄 Pending | Placeholders to be created after deployment |
| Docker images | ❌ Not started | Need Dockerfiles or build strategy |
| rhino-vm module | ❌ Not started | Phase 2 |
| shared-appserver module | ❌ Not started | Phase 2 |
| app-stack module | ❌ Not started | Phase 3 |

## 🚀 Recommended Next Action

**Option A: Deploy Platform Core Now**

Deploy what we have and verify it works:
```bash
./scripts/setup-state-backend.sh
export TF_STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=kudusotfstate
cd infra/live/dev/shared/core
terragrunt apply
```

Then we'll tackle images and Phase 2.

**Option B: Build All Modules First**

Complete rhino-vm and shared-appserver modules before deploying anything.

**Which do you prefer?**

I recommend **Option A** - deploy and verify the core platform works, then incrementally add the rest. This follows your dev principles: small steps, validate each one.

## Questions?

1. Should we deploy the platform core now and verify it works?
2. Do you want to review the Terraform code before applying?
3. Any questions about the structure or configuration?
